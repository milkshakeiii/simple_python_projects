print("One element of the extraterrestrial excitement of this event is choosing the exact nearby star towards which to trek.  The Planetary Python Society has already narrowed down the options to a short list of stars with names starting with the letter A.  Unfortunately, the short list accidentally got mixed into a very long list.  Fortunately, none of the items from the long list start with A.  It's your job to recover the short list of stars and choose one to be your destination.  Use the handy python script name_chooser.py to do so.")
